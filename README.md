# Pokemon Game
This program is a Pokemon turn-based game that uses a GUI.  The player can build a team of Pokemon and play against the program.  The driver file is PokemonGUI.java, while the PokemonPanel.java file contains most of the code.

This project demonstrates:
- Creating a Pokemon class and instantiating objects to use in the game
- Creating a custom "PokemonException" exception class
- Use of GUI tools including java.awt.* and javax.swing.*
- Use of buttons and ActionListeners
- Proper JavaDoc documentation
